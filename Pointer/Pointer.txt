 
Basics of pointer :

What is pointer?
=>pointers are variable that store the address of other variables.
 That means is stores other data-types address.

 &==> this is known as adress ooperator(that holds the address)
 *==> This is known as point to the variable of memory.
 Example-1:
 int a=4;
 int *b=&a;
 [It will print a hexadecimal address of that a also the same of b.]
 
so from that we can confirm that (&) is the address prining operation.

and (*)target point variable operator.
